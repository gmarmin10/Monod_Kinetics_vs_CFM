# Monod_Kinetics_vs_CFM
Quantifying macromolecular allocation of nutrients within phytoplankton using the the Cell Flux model of Phytoplankton


Please download all the files in order for the main code to run. The main code here is titled, 1) "macro_allocation". 

Figures produced by this model
  1) Growth rate vs nitrate concentration
  2) Macromolecular allocation of nitrate expressed in N:C vs nitrate concentration
  3) Macromolecular allocation of carbon vs nitrate concentration
